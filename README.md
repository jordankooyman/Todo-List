# Todo-List
A basic todo-list program for COP1500 as my Integration Project

Specifications:
A sortable list of items that can be added, removed, edited, show/hide hidden, and marked complete (hidden) that is stored in a .txt file
Read data upon program launch - if file is not present, generate new file
If file fails to load, propmt for data overwrite or program exit
Data stored in a list, modified from there, and saved to the file when printed to the screen
Includes a priority system (allowing duplicate priorities, or inserting and moving the rest of the list down a priority
Menu navigation done with the usage of numeric inputs rather than spelled out commands for ease of use
